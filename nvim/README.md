# ATTENTION

I have recently moved to JetBrains IDEs for my everyday work tasks. It's felt a bit stupidly, but I love all the experience I've got by playing around with Neovim and its new community-driven environment. For me I've choosed that it taked too much work to get all what I need with Neovim, but your choose is yours. This configuration now is placed here for historical purposes.
